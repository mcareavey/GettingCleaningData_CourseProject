# Overview and Source Files

# Explanation
The course project entailed of 5 different steps, with each step requiring code to be written and added to a script labeled “run_analysis.R”.  The culmination of these 5 steps resulted in the CourseProject_TidyData.txt file that has been separately uploaded on Coursera.org.  The run_analysis.R file is best viewed/altered in RStudio.
